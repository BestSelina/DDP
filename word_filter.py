"""
Word Filter and Counter Function

Objective:
Write a function named 'word_filter_counter' that filters and counts specific words in a given text.

Function Parameters:
1. text (string): The text from which words will be filtered and counted.
2. filter_words (list of strings): A list of words to be filtered out from the text.

Instructions:
- The function should filter out the words from the text that are present in the filter_words list. The comparison should be case-insensitive.
- The function should return a dictionary. In this dictionary, the keys are the filtered words, and the values are the counts of how often these words appeared in the text.
- The text may contain punctuation marks and spaces. Only whole words, separated by spaces or punctuation, should be considered.

Example Test Cases:
1. word_filter_counter("Hello world, hello!", ["hello"]) should return a dictionary with the count of occurrences of "hello".
2. word_filter_counter("The quick brown fox.", ["the"]) should return a dictionary with the count of occurrences of "the".
3. word_filter_counter("Is this real life? Is this just fantasy?", ["is", "this", "just"]) should return a dictionary with the counts of occurrences of "is", "this", and "just".
4. word_filter_counter("Do we see the big picture or just small details?", ["we", "the", "or"]) should return a dictionary with the counts of occurrences of "we", "the", and "or".
